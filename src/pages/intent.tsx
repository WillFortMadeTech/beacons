    <p className="govuk-body">
      The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) collect and retain the personal
      information provided when you register a UK coded 406 MHz beacon.
      Processing your information allows the MCA to exercise its official duty
      and to identify persons in distress and helps save lives.
    </p>

    <p className="govuk-body">
      We will retain your information until we are advised that the beacon is no
      longer active, for example it has been removed from the vessel, replaced
      or destroyed.
    </p>

    <p className="govuk-body">
      We will share your information with Global Search &amp; Rescue authorities
      and those delegated authorities, such as RNLI Lifeboats, Police or Rescue
      Helicopter crew, that are directly involved with investigations relating
      to a beacon activation.
