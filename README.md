## Style Guide
We use [Prettier-Java](https://github.com/jhipster/prettier-java/tree/c1f867092f74ebfdf68ccb843f8186c943bfdeca) to format our code and we have [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) to run the formatting as a pre-commit hook.

The choices that Prettier makes can be found [here](https://prettier.io/docs/en/rationale.html).
