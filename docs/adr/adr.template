# ADR template by Michael Nygard

This template is adapted from [Documenting architecture decisions template by Michael Nygard](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record/blob/master/adr_template_by_michael_nygard.md).

The format of each ADR file should be `NNNN-YYYY-MM-DD-title-with-dashes.md`, where `NNNN` indicates then next number in the sequence.

In each ADR file, document these sections:

# Title

## Status

What is the status, such as proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded, etc.?

## Context

What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

## Decision

What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?
