        The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) collect and retain the personal information provided when you register a UK coded 406 MHz beacon. Processing your information allows the MCA to exercise its official duty and to identify persons in distress and helps save lives.
      </p>
      <p
        class="govuk-body"
      >
        We will retain your information until we are advised that the beacon is no longer active, for example it has been removed from the vessel, replaced or destroyed.
      </p>
      <p
        class="govuk-body"
      >
        We will share your information with Global Search & Rescue authorities and those delegated authorities, such as RNLI Lifeboats, Police or Rescue Helicopter crew, that are directly involved with investigations relating to a beacon activation.
